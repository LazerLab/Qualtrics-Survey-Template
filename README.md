# Qualtrics-Survey-Template
Template for using Qualtrics surveys on Volunteer Science

Note: In order to replicate this template, the Qualtrics .qsf file should be uploaded to Qualtrics (not Volunteer Science). It contains the data embedding for subjectId and testId as well as an example of the message passing js code you need to communicate with Volunteer Science.
